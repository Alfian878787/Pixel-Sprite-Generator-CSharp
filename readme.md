All I did here was a quick lazy port of [zfedoran's procedural sprite generator](https://github.com/zfedoran/pixel-sprite-generator) to C# as a WPF app in Visual Studio 2015.

The point of it was only to familiarize myself a little with C# basics.

It should be easy to take what's in SpriteGen and put it in any game engine that uses C#. See also: [Shogan's port of this same algorithm for Unity](https://github.com/Shogan/PixelSpriteGenerator-Unity).
