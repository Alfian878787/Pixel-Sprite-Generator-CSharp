All I did here was simply port [zfedoran's procedural sprite generator](https://github.com/zfedoran/pixel-sprite-generator) to C# as a WPF app in Visual Studio 2015.

The point of it was only to familiarize myself a little with C# basics. Sorry about the lack of documentation in my code. To understand what any given part does, see zfedoran's source code which is well documented.

It should be easy to take what's in SpriteGen and put it in any game engine that uses C#, such as Unity.
